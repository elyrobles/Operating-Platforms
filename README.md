# Operating-Platforms

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a company that desired for their current "Draw It or Lose It" Android game to serve several other platforms besides just android. Their software requirements included to have multiple players for each team, multiple teams involved in each game, unique team and game names, and only one instance of a game existing in memory at any given time.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In developing the documentation, what I did particularly well was evaluating the server and client side, and describing the advantages and weakness of Linux, Mac, Windows, and Mobile devices. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
When developing the code, what was the most helpful for me was The Gaming Room UML diagram. I find the writing code from a UML diagram like that makes the process so effortless. Even before starting the coding process, and making a brief diagram helps to provide me some direction, and I plan to continue doing that for future projects. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would likely wnat to go back and revise my distributed sytems and network recommendations section, although I did touch on a lot of important aspects, I think I should've gone a bit more in depth about having several nodes and how it would work if there was to be failfure, having a distributed system would not cause that one failure to mess up the whole system. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
If I want to make sure that the client has a web-based application that serves several platforms and contains all the desired software requirments, then they will be satisfied and have an application that works well with their needs. This can build a good relationship between Creative Technology Solutions and The Gaming Room, and possibly provide CTS with more projects from The Gaming Room. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach to designing software was to primarly understand my clients requirements and how to go about implementing those requirements. Also it was imperative to figure out what could be the constraints in the project, and how to go about solving those issues. The next thing was to describe to the client what the advantages and disadvantages would be for having a Linux, Mac, and Windows based game, and how that could effect them cost wise.
